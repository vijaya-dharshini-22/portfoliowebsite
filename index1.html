        <p class="section-two__desc">
            I am vijayadharshini, currently pursuing my MCA at EGS Pillay Engineering College. Before this, I completed my BCA at EGS Pillay Arts and Science College, where I built a solid foundation in computer science and technology. Throughout my academic journey, I've developed a deep interest in the fields of cybersecurity and IT systems, which led me to choose projects that tackle real-world issues. During my undergraduate studies, I worked on a project titled "Preventing Phishing Attacks Using a Database Monitoring System." The aim of the project was to create a system that could monitor and detect phishing activities through continuous analysis of database transactions, helping to safeguard sensitive information from cyber threats. This project not only enhanced my skills in database management but also deepened my understanding of cybersecurity protocols. Through this experience, I realized the importance of proactive measures in protecting online data and preventing cybercrimes. I am enthusiastic about continuing to expand my knowledge in these areas and hope to contribute to the development of more advanced and secure systems in the future. With my academic background and hands-on project experience, I am committed to making a meaningful impact in the field of IT, particularly in cybersecurity.
